				<h2>Maker at heart</h2>
				<p>.</p>
				<p>My story begins in Europe, but doesn't really get interesting until I move to the US and learn to write. Since then, I've been making things left and right, mostly bad, some good. Eventually, I found my way to NYC for college, where I code, write, translate, shiver, draw, play, and work hard. I'm a writer, coder, and translator. I'm a design junkie, a literature nerd, an animation connoisseur, and an eyeliner afficionado. When not being productive, my favorite forms of procrastination are making things on Scratch,  I make things on Scratch, watching Netflix, and bakeing. I spend a lot of time wishing my dorm allowed pets, trying to animate, and searching for the perfect coffee. Which shouldn't be hard in NYC, but it is.</p>

				<h1>I know a lot of things</h1>
				<h2>For example ...</h2>
				<p>My first 'IDE' was the beautiful screen of my highschool TI-85. I started coding to make my Linear Algebra homework easier, and haven't looked back. Luckily, I've learned some more fruitful languages. Now I code in
					<ul>
						<strong>
							<li>Java</li>
							<li>C/C++</li>
							<li>PHP</li>
							<li>HTML/CSS</li>
							<li>Javascript</li>
							<li>and Python</li>
						</strong>
					</ul>
				and I taught myself all but three of those. I've done front-end and back-end, research in labs, and programming instruction.</p>
				<p>I'm fluent in French (and English) and am really good at Latin. English is my birth-language, but French is a close second, and I took Latin just for fun. I translate between all three of those langauges, mostly for small buisnesses and individuals, and I'm always ready to tutor. If you need your site translated, hit me up!</p>
